        <h2 id="headline"><u>Dr. William H. Bates Life & The Bates Method History</u></h2>
        <p>Dr. Bates started his career as an orthodox ophthalmologist following the old, long time rules of the practice; prescribing eyeglasses...
          During his practice, working with different patients, eye conditions, he realized that unclear close, distant vision, astigmatism and other conditions often cured itself, reversed back to clear vision, especially when his patients stopped wearing their eyeglasses. He noticed that wearing glasses weakened the eyes, resulted in stronger and stronger eyeglass lens prescriptions being needed in order to see clear through the glasses. He began his own studies on the eye and its function. This led him to discover that many of the old ophthalmologist, optometry 'supposed facts' about the eye, lens and its function and cause of unclear vision... are incorrect. Dr. Bates began teaching his patients to avoid eyeglasses, stop wearing their glasses. He taught them natural methods, including relaxation, correct use of the eyes, practice of normal, natural eye function to improve the vision. Dr. Bates cured his own eyesight, close vision, presbyopia. Distant vision also clear. He wrote an Article in his book, magazines describing how he did it with Memory, Imagination, Relaxation. He controlled, changed the focus of light rays in his eyes with his mind.
          Dr. Bates performed experiments on the eyes of animals, and observed the function of thousands of animal, patient's eyes under different conditions, situations, state of mind, body, thoughts and emotions. He used the retinoscope to see the refraction, focus of light rays in the eye under these various conditions. He proved that the refraction, clarity of vision changes often and when the eyes are left alone, eyeglasses avoided, the refraction, clarity returns to normal, clear vision. He proved that the state of the mind, thoughts change the refraction of the eye, clarity of vision. Example: when the mind, body is relaxed, positive, happy thoughts, emotions: the refraction is normal and vision is clear. When the mind, body is under stress, strain: the refraction is abnormal and vision is unclear. Dr. Bates discovered that the main cause of unclear vision and other eye problems is: Wearing Eyeglasses, Mental Strain, Mental, Visual Effort to See, Incorrect Vision Habits (incorrect use of the eyes: squinting, staring, not shifting, lack of central-fixation, low memory, imagination...). Perfect Sight occurs only with Perfect Relaxation (deep or active/dynamic relaxation - See Aldous Huxley's book: The Art of Seeing). Relaxation occurs first and then the eyesight becomes clear.
          His experiments on the outer eye muscles proved that tension in these muscles disrupts their function, the eyes movement, accommodation, convergence, un-accommodation, divergence, causes pressure, tension on/in the eve. alters the eves shaoe. (and lensL dis runts focus of liaht ravs on the retina and the claritv of vision. Circulation in the eyes is also affected.
          Mental strain, stress, strain in the mind, negative thoughts, emotions cause eye muscle tension. Neck muscle tension causes eye muscle tension and neck tension is caused by mental strain, negative thoughts, emotions, incorrect posture, injury: vertebrae out of alignment). Inner eye muscle tension; ciliary/lens, iris, tear gland muscle... also occurs. When the mind is strained, tense, the brain and retina do not communicate, function together at optimum level, function of the retina is lowered.
          Dr. Bates proved that MENTAL STRAIN causes unclear vision. RELAXATION of the mind produces clear vision. Dr. Bates used his retinoscope to show that the refraction/focus of light rays in the eye are disrupted resulting in unclear vision when a person lies. Lying causes a bit of mental strain. When the person tells the truth-no strain occurs, the refraction is perfect and vision clear. Many things can cause mental strain. Avoid eyeglasses, remove the stress, strain and vision returns to clear. Practice of Natural Eyesight Improvement can uncover old, forgotten stressful experiences, resulting in strong emotions, feelings being remembered, activated. Once the memory, feelings are acknowledged, released and new positive thoughts, emotions placed into the brain, system: often the vision immediately returns to normal 20/20 and clearer. No other practice is needed. The eyes relax, move, 'shift... correct on their own.
          Dr. Bates published Medical Articles, Books describing his experiments on the eyes, eye muscles, the effect of memory on the eyes, vision and the effect of the clarity of vision on the memory: 1891 'A Study of Images Reflected from the Cornea, Iris, Lens, and Sclera' & 'Memory as an Aid to Vision'. These Articles and others are placed in his 1920 book: The Cure of Imperfect Sight by Treatment without Glasses, Better Eyesight Magazine and his Medical Articles E-Book.
          Dr. Bates created Natural Treatments, Activities to cure: reverse, correct and prevent unclear vision and other eye conditions based on his discoveries. This became know as 'The Bates Method'. Glaucoma, cataracts and other eye conditions were also reversed successfully with Dr. Bates Natural Treatments.
          He made other discoveries, eye surgery inventions. Later, after he discovered the natural function of the eyes, vision, he stopped use of certain surgeries and cured the eyes-vision with his natural method.

      <p><em>Emily Lierman/Bates, Dr. Harold Peppard, Dr. William B. MacCracken, C.S. Price, Clara Hackett, Margaret Corbett, Aldous Huxley and others continue to teach The Bates Method. Better Eyesight Magazine and Bates Books, Articles were Preserved. Bates Teachers work in Cities in the U.S.A., England, Germany, Spanish Teachers, South Africa,..</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>1940 - Emily Lierman, Bates re-published Dr. Bates book with an additional chapter teaching The Bates Method's Application: The Fundamental Principles of Treatment.
